Lord Shiva, only becomes able. <BR>
To do creation in this world along with Shakthi <BR>
Without her, Even an inch he cannot move, <BR>
And so how can, one who does not do good deeds, <BR>
Or one who does not sing your praise, <BR>
Become adequate to worship you <BR>
Oh , goddess mine, Who is worshipped by the trinity. <BR>

 <BR>
Lord Brahma ,the creator of yore, <BR>
Selects a dust from your feet, <BR>
And creates he this world, <BR>
The great Adisesha* with his thousand heads, <BR>
Some how carries a dust of your feet, <BR>

 <BR>
The dust under your feet, Oh Goddess great, <BR>
Is like the city of the rising sun, <BR>
That removes all darkness , unfortunate, <BR>
From the mind of the poor ignorant one, <BR>
Is like the honey that flows , <BR>
From the flower bunch of vital action, <BR>
To the slow witted one, <BR>
Is like the heap of wish giving gems, <BR>
To the poorest of men, <BR>
And is like the teeth of Lord Vishnu <BR>
In the form of Varaha, <BR>
Who brought to surface, <BR>
The mother earth, <BR>
To those drowned in this sea of birth. <BR>

For even your holy feet will suffice, <BR>
To remove fear for ever, <BR>
And grant boons much more than asked. <BR>

 <BR>
You who grant all the good things, <BR>
To those who bow at your feet, <BR>
Was worshipped by the Lord Vishnu, <BR>

And could move the mind of he who burnt the cities, <BR>
And make him fall in love with him. <BR>
And the God of love , Manmatha, <BR>
Took the form which is like nectar, <BR>
Drunk by the eyes by Rathi his wife, <BR>
After venerating you, <BR>
Was able to create passion , <BR>
Even in the mind of Sages the great. <BR>

Oh ,daughter of the mountain of ice, <BR>
With a bow made of flowers, <BR>
Bow string made of honey bees, <BR>
Five arrows made of only tender flowers, <BR>
With spring as his minister, <BR>
And riding on the chariot of breeze from Malaya mountains <BR>
The god of love who does not have a body, <BR>
Gets the sideways glance of your holy eyes, <BR>
And is able to win all the world alone. <BR>

With a thin pretty form, <BR>
And with a face like the autumn moon, <BR>
Holding in her hands, <BR>
A bow of sugar cane , arrows made of flowers, <BR>
And the noose and goad, <BR>
She who has the wonderful form, <BR>

Of the power of water of Mani poora, <BR>
Of the power of fire of Swadhishtana, <BR>
Of the fire of air in the heart, <BR>
And of the power of ether in between the eyelids* <BR>
 <BR>
ï¿½ The Devotees who use Raja yoga believe that right below the back bone there exists a very micro nerve called Sushmna. Below this is the mooladhara chakra(The wheel which is the ultimate basis),and two inches above is the Swadishtana (ego wishes wheel) chakra and above that and opposite to the belly button is mani pooraka(the complete gem wheel) chakra and above that opposite to the heart is Anahatha chakra(deathless wheel) and above that opposite to the throat is the Vishuddhi chaka(wheel of ultimate cleanliness) and above that in between the eyelids is the Agna chakra(Wheel of order ) and in the bottom of the brain is the Sahasrara chakra(the wheel of thousand lotus),They belive that the malefic bad thoughts of men sleeps in the mooladhara chakra in the form of a snake called Kundalini..If the devotee can wake up this snake and lead it through each of the above wheels, step by step and make it reach the Sahasrara, he attains ultimate redemption and sees the ultimate truth behind everything. <BR>

Who do not have control of their senses. <BR>
And that is why perhaps, <BR>
Indra and other Gods, <BR>
Stay outside your gates, <BR>
And attain your sweet self, <BR>
By practice of siddhis like Anima. <BR>

(Attainment of knowledge and wealth) <BR>
Kalathram vaidhathram kathi kathi bhajante na kavayah <BR>
Sriyo devyah ko va na bhavati pathih kairapi dhanaih; <BR>
Mahadevam hithva thava sathi sathinam acharame <BR>
Kuchabhyam aasangah kuravaka-tharor apyasulabhah. <BR>
 <BR>
Many poets reach the Goddess of learning, <BR>
The wife of the creaor, <BR>
By composing soulfull poems. <BR>
Many who search and attain riches, <BR>
Are termed as the Lord of the Goddess of wealth. <BR>
Oh, first among chaste woman, <BR>
Except Lord Shiva your consort. <BR>
Your breasts have not even touched, <BR>
The holy henna* tree. <BR>
 <BR>

(Redemption of the soul) <BR>
Giram aahur devim Druhina-gruhinim agaamavidho <BR>
Hareh pathnim padhmam Hara-sahacharim adhri-thanayam; <BR>
Thuriya kapi thvam dhuradhigama-niseema-mahima <BR>
Maha-maya visvam bhramayasi parabhrahma mahishi. <BR>
 <BR>
Oh , Parashakthi who is one with Parabrahma, <BR>
Though those who have learned Vedas, <BR>
Call you as Brahma's wife Sarawathi, <BR>
Or call you as Vishnu's wife Lakshmi, <BR>
Or call you as Shiva's wife Parvathi, <BR>
You are the fourth called Maha Maya, <BR>
Who gives life to the world, <BR>
And have attained all that is to attain. <BR>

(Mastery over words) <BR>
Kadha kaale mathah kathaya kalith'alakthaka-rasam <BR>
Pibheyam vidyarthi thava charana-nirnejana-jalam; <BR>
Prakrithya mukhanam api cha kavitha-karanathaya <BR>
Kadha dhathe vani-mukha-kamala-thambula-rasatham. <BR>
 <BR>
Oh , mother mine, <BR>
When shall I , who begs for knowledge <BR>
Be able to drink, the nectar like water, <BR>
Flowing from your feet, <BR>
Mixed with reddish lac applied there? <BR>
When shall that water attain, <BR>
The goodness of saliva mixed with Thambola*, <BR>
From the mouth of goddess of learning, <BR>
Which made one born as mute, <BR>
Into the king of poets? <BR>
 <BR>

(Attainment of ultimate bliss) <BR>
Saraswathya lakshmya vidhi hari sapathno viharathe <BR>
Rathe pathivrithyam sidhilayathi ramyena vapusha <BR>
Chiram jivannehva kshapathi pasu pasa vyathikara <BR>
Paranandabhikhyam rasayathi rasam twadjanavaan. <BR>
 <BR>
Those who worship thee , oh mother, <BR>
Are so learned and so rich, <BR>
That even Brahma and Vishnu, <BR>
Are jealous of them <BR>
They are so handsome, <BR>
That even the wife of Cupid, Rathi, <BR>
Yearns for them. <BR>
He unbound from the ties of this birth, <BR>
Always enjoys ecstasic happiness, <BR>
And lives for ever . <BR>

Pradhipa-jvalabhir dhivasa-kara-neerajana-vidhih <BR>
Sudha-suthes chandropala-jala-lavair arghya-rachana; <BR>
Svakiyair ambhobhih salila-nidhi-sauhitya karanam <BR>
Tvadiyabhir vagbhis thava janani vacham stutir iyam. <BR>
 <BR>
Oh Goddess who is the source of all words, <BR>
This poem which is made of words, <BR>
That you only made, <BR>
Is like showing the camphor lamp to the Sun, <BR>
Is like offering as ablation to the moon, <BR>
The water got from the moon stone, <BR>
And is like offering water worship, <BR>
To the sea. <BR>
